This project is my implementation of the classic game TicTacToe in C++;

---
## Setup
Clone the repository, and just run the main.exe file to start the game.<br>
If you want to make changes to the project, you can modify the main.cpp file located in src/ and in order to compile you have to use **make run** in a terminal and everything will compile and run.

##  Features
When you open the app, you are welcomed with the main menu. You can go through the whole app using *arrows* or *WASD* and **[ENTER]** to select an option.<br>
If you choose to play, then you will enter the 2 players names and the game will begin. At the moment you can only play with another friend using the same system, but I will add a bot mode soon.<br>

<br>
After the match, the scores will be added in the leaderboard system. This system is counting everyone that has ever played the game on your system. If the player wins, 1 point will be added to his score and if the player looses, 1 point will be taken.<br>
